# Sustainable Computing Sandbox

🌱 Experimental environment to develop on energy- and carbon-aware cloud-native software. 

## 📦 Components

- Local cloud infrastructure
- Energy consumption monitoring stack
- Carbon emission monitoring stack
- Machine learning infrastructure and workloads
- Visualization stack
- Execution management tool

## 📋 Requirements

This project uses the [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner for ergonomic development. To install with [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html):

```sh
cargo install just
```

## 🛠️ Installation

Download and install all necessary requirements:

```sh
just install requirements
```

## ⚡ Usage

To start the cluster and deploy all components:

> Note: Deployment might fail if a VPN is active.

```sh
just init
```

To deploy specific components:

```sh
just deploy infra  # spin up a local cluster, without deploying other components
just deploy [energy-monitoring|carbon-monitoring|machine-learning|visualization]
```

To run a workload, for example to test energy consumption or carbon emission monitoring:

```sh
just run [machine-learning]  # run all workloads defined in machine-learning
```

### 🖥️ Dashboards

If deployed, visualizations can be accessed with:

```sh
just view  # opens all dashboards
just view [kepler|flyte]
```

## 🧹 Teardown

To remove everything:

```sh
just teardown  # remove the entire cluster, including all components 
```

To remove specific components:

```sh
just teardown [energy-monitoring|carbon-monitoring|machine-learning|visualization]
```
